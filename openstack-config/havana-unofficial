# Unofficial OpenStack Projects
# as described at https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Projects
#
# Related - unofficial projects with no rights to use OpenStack brand and 
# assets or project resources 
# 
# Related projects are made up of projects that have chosen to associate 
# themselves with OpenStack. These projects are not officially tied to 
# OpenStack or any OpenStack processes or resources, but may make use of 
# OpenStack or add functionality on top of OpenStack projects. The "related 
# project" designation is meant to provide an aggregation method for the 
# community to expose useful projects and products in the OpenStack 
# ecosystem that are not directly part of the core or incubated projects.
