# openstack bucket projects
# these are projects that are developed within the openstack atmosphere
# (i.e. they are not "unofficial" per se), but are not explicitly 
# listed at https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Projects.  Since I'm not
# sure where they should go, but I want to be able to measure them,
# I'm putting them into a 'havana-bucket' list
